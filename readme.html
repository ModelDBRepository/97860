This is the model demonstrated in Supplementary Information:

Figure S5: Computer simulation of the role of HCN gating in pacemaking
of DA neurons. a. NEURON simulation of autonomous spiking in an SNc DA
neuron.  Elimination of voltage-dependent Na+ channels revealed Cav1.3
L-type Ca2+ channel dependent pacemaker potentials, similar to that
found in recorded neurons. b. Elevating intracellular cAMP in the
model following the model of Siegelbaum et al. 48 produced a rightward
shift in the voltage of activation for HCN channels. This shift
increased HCN currents in a simulated voltage clamp experiment in much
the same way as seen experimentally (see Supplementary Figs. 3,
4). c. Elimination of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channel silenced pacemaking
activity in the model SNc DA neuron, resembling experimental
observation.  Elevating cAMP levels and shifting HCN voltage
dependence restored pacemaking activity in the face of Cav1.3 L-type
Ca2+ channel blockade.

Sample model usage:

Start the model with auto-launch in ModelDB or download and extract
the archive and then

under mswin:
------------
1) compile the mod files with mknrndll (in the mod directory)
2) double click on the mosinit.hoc file

under linux/unix:
-----------------
1) compile the mod files with nrnivmodl (in the mod directory)
2) start with "nrngui mosinit.hoc" in the rejuvenation directory


Once the simulation is started:
-------------------------------
1) Click Init & Run

2) Click the box to turn off Na channels to see the Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+
channel dependent pacemaker potentials

If all goes well you will create a figure similar to figure S5A in the
paper:
